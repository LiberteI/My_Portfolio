My Portfolio

Overview:
This project will be kept updating tho i finished the MVP on Dec 26 2025.
There are several sections in the page. HomePage, About, Project(CS), Performance(Music) Contact, Testimonial.
I created a gamified homepage for greeting, replicating a retro game vibe. NPC can update its animation based on timer or user click. After click, it gives a thumbup and show 3 social links of mine.
There is a beautiful parallax background with a side scrolling sky. Nav bar can hide itself if user is not at the top of the page. buttons are functioning to scroll to designated places.

The about page shows a overview of my journey and interest. I also list all my tech stack here.

Next I have a My Project. GitHub link is shared with description and clickable img that gives a route to the project's detail page. User can download build or watch anything relevant.

After that i have a section to showcase my music journey(public performances/musical arrangements)

Moreover, I have a Get In Touch page, where user can access my email or linkedin. User can also send me a quick message by filling the form. i will receive an email from this.

Last but not least: Testimonial. I have an npc to give user hints to leave comments. but before that user must login using google or Linkedin. User will go to a shared database. if multiple accounts use the same email, there will not be any duplicate users.

Comments will be displayed on at the same place. 
After logging in, user can click on Leave A Comment button, where user is redirected to a form. 
If this user is admin, form will also show all the comments, which user can decide which to show. If user is not admin, user can only submit a comment.
